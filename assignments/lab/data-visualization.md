# Database Outputs (Data Visualization) Lab Assignment

You may use any data visualization tool or software to complete this assignment.

If you would like to use Tableau software, refer to this [tutorial](/resources/group-project/toolsets/tableau/tableau-tutorial.md).

## Description

Find a real-world dataset. You may choose the same dataset you chose for your single-table or relational data analysis assignments, or you may choose a different dataset. If you get stuck, try this [health inspections dataset](https://github.com/gwu-business/open-data-library/tree/master/relational-data/evanston_healthscores).

Download and import the dataset into the DBMS of your choice.
 Assign indices and datatypes as appropriate. Explore the data. Expand/re-design the database, if helpful, by adding new tables and/or saving query results.

Investigate and analyze the data for the purpose of processing it into meaningful information. Focus on a single question to answer or story to tell.

Think of how to best convey that information in graphical form. Draw/sketch by hand visualization(s) which convey with clarity and accuracy the chosen information/message.

Ask other members of the learning community for feedback on your draft visualization.

Choose a visualization tool.

Either set up a direct connection between the visualization software and the database (recommended, to facilitate refreshable dashboards), or export database table(s) and/or database query results to a local .csv file and import that text file into the visualization software.

Replicate and expand-upon your infographic sketch using a digital data visualization tool.

Ask other members of the learning community for feedback on your final visualization.

Export the resulting chart(s) to a single .pdf file.

### Suggested visual design elements:

  + title
  + legend
  + axis labels
  + data labels and totals (as necessary)
  + footer text box optionally containing:
   + datasource identification
   + methodology description
   + chart clarifications/disambiguations
