# Logical Database Design

Proper relational database design produces proper database function.

Proper database functionality requires the absence of factual inconsistencies.

An **anomaly** is "an error or inconsistency that may result when a user attempts to update a table that contains redundant data" ([4](/LICENSE.md/#accompanying-textbook)).

Data redundancy, or duplicity, presents opportunities for data insertion, deletion, and modification errors.

Therefore, the main objective of the database design process is to minimize data redundancy.

A proper relational database design may entirely eliminate data redundancies,
 however reasonable business assumptions and decisions about database scope often
 dictate intentional incorporation of a limited amount of redundancy.

A properly designed database provides business value in terms at least of:

 + decreased processing costs
 + decreased likelihood for factual errors/discrepancies
 + increased likelihood of data quality/integrity/confidence

## Denormalized Data

Datasets in various forms may contain repeating groups of attribute values.

Repeating groups of attribute values is common and proper quality of datasets which are used to produce charts, dashboards, statistical analyses, or other outputs which aid decision-making.

This
  [activity report](https://github.com/gwu-business/radio-data/blob/master/reports/activity_report.csv) is an example of a denormalized dataset. For additional clarity, import it into a DBMS and examine it with the following SQL query:

```` sql
SELECT *
FROM activity_report
ORDER BY listener_full_name, song_title, artist_name, started_listening_at DESC
````

## Normalization

**Normalization** is the simplification process by which a data architect arrives at a proper database design.

Normalization involves "... decomposing relations with anomalies to produce smaller, well-structured relations" ([4](/LICENSE.md/#accompanying-textbook)).

Normalization aims to eliminate the presence of functional dependencies.

A **functional dependency** is "... a constraint between two attributes by which the value of one (determines) the value of the other" ([4](/LICENSE.md/#accompanying-textbook)).

A **transitive dependency** is a functional dependency in which "... one or more non-key attributes (depend) on the primary key through another non-key attribute" ([4](/LICENSE.md/#accompanying-textbook)).

### Stages of Normalization

There are three general stages of the normalization process.

It is sometimes helpful or necessary to stop at a intermediate stages, but the ultimate goal is to reach Third Normal Form (3NF), which contains no functional dependencies.

#### First Normal Form

**First Normal Form (1NF)** is a
 "... relation that has a primary key and in which there are no repeating groups" ([4](/LICENSE.md/#accompanying-textbook)).

#### Second Normal Form

**Second Normal Form (2NF)** is a relation which satisfies the conditions of 1NF and also "... every non-key attribute (depends) on the primary key." ([4](/LICENSE.md/#accompanying-textbook)).

2NF may contain one or more transitive dependencies.

#### Third Normal Form

**Third Normal Form (3NF)** is a relation which satisfies the conditions of 2NF and also "... has no transitive dependencies" ([4](/LICENSE.md/#accompanying-textbook)).
