A **relational database** is "a database that represents data as a collection of of tables in which all data relationships are represented by common values in related tables" ([1](/LICENSE.md/#accompanying-textbook)).

Within the context of relational database design, a **relation** refers to a "named, two-dimensional table of data" ([4](/LICENSE.md/#accompanying-textbook)).
