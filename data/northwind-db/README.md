# Data Source

This database was re-constituted from this setup script: https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3/blob/master/Northwind.Sqlite3.create.sql

See also: https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/

Then I deleted all the views / queries and re-saved the file as "northwind-lite.db" to make it easier for students to learn.
